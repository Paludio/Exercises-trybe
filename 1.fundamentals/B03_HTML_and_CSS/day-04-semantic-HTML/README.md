<h1>I lear about semantic HTML</h1>

* Do use elements HTML in accord with the sense and purpose that they carry. This elements include, but are not limited to: **header**, **nav**, **article**, **section**, **footer** and **img**;

* Create pages semantically valid and accessible;

* Understand the diference in between elements of block and elements *inline*.
